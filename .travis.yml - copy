services:
  - docker # Travis CI will install a copy of Docker for our workload

before_install: # this will be done before deploying our code or runing our tests
  - docker build -t brennobiwan/docker-react -f Dockerfile.dev . # command to run in order to build the Docker image

script: # this will contain the code that will run our test suite; Travis CI watches the output of each command and expects the returning ode to be 0, otherwise it considers the test a failure
  - docker run -e CI=true brennobiwan/docker-react npm run test -- --coverage  # this is for "npm run test" to exit automatically once the test finishes
  # Travis assumes that the test suite exits automatically. As "npm run test" doesn't by default -- it waits for an input from the user --, Travis will be hanging waiting for a code to return
